# Handlers tell app engine how to route requests to your application.
handlers:

# Route requests to static files (and subdirectories) in the listed
# directories.

- url: /robots.txt
  static_files: static/robots.txt
  upload: static/robots.txt

# This handler tells app engine how to route requests to a WSGI application.
# The script value is in the format <path.to.module>.<wsgi_application>
# where <wsgi_application> is a WSGI application object.
- url: .*  # This regex directs all routes to main.app

# Third party libraries that are included in the App Engine SDK must be listed
# here if you want to use them.  See
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27 for
# a list of libraries included in the SDK.  Third party libs that are *not* part
# of the App Engine SDK don't need to be listed here, instead add them to your
# project directory, either as a git submodule or as a plain subdirectory.
# Note that dependencies must be located in your project directory - packages
# installed in the Python environment are not loaded by the App Engine development
# server or deployment tools.
